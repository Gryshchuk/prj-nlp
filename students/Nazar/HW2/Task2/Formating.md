```The Associated Press Stylebook is a style guide widely used among American journalists. It enforces the following rules for capitalization of news headlines:

Capitalize nouns, pronouns, adjectives, verbs, adverbs, and subordinate conjunctions. If a word is hyphenated, every part of the word should be capitalized (e.g., "Self-Reflection" not "Self-reflection").
Capitalize the first and the last word.
Lowercase all other parts of speech: articles, coordinating conjunctions, prepositions, particles, interjections.
Write a program that formats a headline according to the rules above. Use any programming language and any NLP toolkit.

When done, run your program on the corpus of headlines from The Examiner and submit your program and a file with corrected headlines to your directory. Output statistics: how many titles were properly formatted?

	Correct Titles: 628
